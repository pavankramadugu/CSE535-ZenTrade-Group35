# ZenTrade App

## Introduction
ZenTrade is an innovative mobile application created using Kotlin and Android Studio. It offers a stress-smart investment solution tailored to each investor's needs. The app streamlines the investment process by integrating advanced technology with an intuitive user interface. It provides more than just personalized investment advice. Its standout feature is the expert UI/UX, which allows users to easily input personal data such as country of residence, preferred stock types, risk preferences, and personal information. One of the highlights of ZenTrade is its data visualization capabilities, particularly evident in the recommendations section. Here, users receive well-structured, tabular stock recommendations based on comprehensive server-side data analysis.

## Key Files
I contributed to several primary files, including `activity_instruments_to_trade.xml`, `activity_markets_to_trade.xml`, and `activity_recommendations.xml`, along with their respective Kotlin files. These files are integral to the project and rely on the other files in the repository for full functionality. It's important to include the entire project code when cloning or pulling from this repository to ensure these files work as intended.
