**ZenTrade App
Introduction**
ZenTrade is an innovative mobile application created with Kotlin and Android Studio. By providing a stress-smart solution appropriate to each investor's needs. The app reduces the investing process by combining technology and an easy-to-use interface, offering more than just customized investment advice. Its expert UI/UX is a key feature, allowing users to easily input personal data such as country of residence, preferred stock types, risk preferences, and personal information. ZenTrade's data visualization features are particularly in the recommendations section. Here, users get well-structured, tabular stock recommendations that are the result of thorough server-side data analysis.

**Key Files**
The primary files I contributed to are named activity_instruments_to_trade.xml, activity_markets_to_trade.xml, and activity_recommendations.xml and their respective kotlin files. These files are integral to the project and depend on the other files in the repository for proper functionality. It is crucial to include the entire project code when cloning or pulling from this repository to ensure these files operate correctly.
